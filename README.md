In this assignment, we use additional county level data from [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/public-assistance-funded-projects-details-v1) to produce maps with more features. The purpose of this assignment is to show our ability of using R to produce documents, presentations, and shiny apps.
